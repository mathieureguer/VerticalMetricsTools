# Vertical Metrics Tools

**VerticalMetricsTools** is a set of tools to interact with vertical metrics data in font files. 
Mostly, it can generate a pdf visualising the states of vertical metrics in a given font. 

## Instalation

VerticalMetricsTools is instalable localy with pip. 
Download the reposotiry and type in the folowing in the terminal:

```bash
pip3 install /path/to/your/downloaded/VerticalMetricsTools
```

(`pip` should be pointed to the directory that contains `setup.py`).

VerticalMetricsTools is runing on Python 3, dependending on the way you installed Python on your machine, you should use either `pip3` or `pip`.
Once the tool is installed, close your temrinal window and open a new one :)


## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal

```bash
vertical_metrics_preview path/to/a/font.otf
```

If all went well, you should find a pdf next to the targeted font. 
Otf, ttf, woff and woff2 are supported. I think.
